# Dynamically Added Content Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the layout of dynamically added content.  When a paragraph element is added to the page using JavaScript, the layout breaks, and the spacing is different from statically added elements.

The bug is caused by missing or incorrect CSS rules that handle the dynamic changes. The solution involves adding appropriate CSS rules to ensure consistent and correct rendering of dynamically added elements.
